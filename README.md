<h1>Building and Securing an AWS VPC</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Create a secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS to establish isolated network environments. Design subnets for public and private resources across different Availability Zones. Configure an Internet Gateway for public access and a NAT Gateway or instance for private subnet internet connectivity. Enhance security using Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) with customized inbound and outbound rules. Explore VPC peering or VPN connections for additional connectivity options. Enable VPC Flow Logs to monitor traffic and ensure high availability by deploying resources across multiple zones.

- <b>A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. It allows you to have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and network gateways. With a VPC, you can securely connect your AWS resources to your on-premises network using VPN or AWS Direct Connect. It provides a secure and scalable infrastructure for running your applications in the cloud while maintaining control over your network configuration.</b>
